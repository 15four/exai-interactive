# Exai Bio 2022 Interactive

## Whatâ€™s included?

- [Webpack 4](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) JavaScript module bundler
- [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/) compiler ES6+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) preprocessor for CSS
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for vendor prefixes (browser compability)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org) JavaScript linter
- [Stylelint](http://stylelint.io) CSS/SASS linter
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) an opinionated code formatter
- [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) run linting and formatting your files that are marked as "staged" via `git add` before you commit.

## Getting started

- run `npm install` to fetch all the dependencies
- run `npm run start` to start the [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) (`localhost:8080` will be opened automatically)
- start developing
- when you are done, run `npm run build` to get the production version of your app

## Commands

- `start` - start the dev server
- `build` - create build in `build` folder
- `analyze` - analyze your production bundle
- `lint-code` - run an ESLint check
- `lint-style` - run a Stylelint check
- `check-eslint-config` - check if ESLint config contains any rules that are unnecessary or conflict with Prettier
- `check-stylelint-config` - check if Stylelint config contains any rules that are unnecessary or conflict with Prettier

## Hosting

As of creation, due to limitations of WebFlow, we're also using this repo also as the [host](https://www.jsdelivr.com/github) for production files. Don't ignore the build folder! If you make another build, you'll just have to change the hash in the file URLs in the Webflow builder to match the new ones.

## Gotchas

This interactive was built on [this boilerplate](https://github.com/vadimmarkov/webpack-es6-sass-boilerplate). Because of that, we have to note some strangeness that could pop up during development.

- The build system uses NodeSASS, which requires Node < 16. We recommend using [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to handle this.
